# Neural network for the recognition of handwritten characters implemented in MATLAB

This was made as a project for my scientific computing class. 

The code is in MATLAB R2023a and implements a 3 layer neural network using the MNIST database of handwritten digits as the input training data.

The code follows the book ["Neural Networks and Deep Learning"](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com), mainly the first chapter.

The [MNIST database of handwritten digits](https://github.com/sunsided/mnist) is used in MATLAB format from [this repository](https://github.com/sunsided/mnist-matlab)

# Neural Network Parameters
The Neural Network consist of 3 layers: 
- Input layers with 784 nodes
- Hidden layer with 15 nodes
- Output layer with 10 nodes

## Note
The parameters can be changed in the code by changing the variables inputSize, hiddenSize, and outputSize. but this will require further changes in the code for it to run.
